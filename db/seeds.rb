# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)
#Adding roles

r1 = Role.create(name: "Retailer")
r2 = Role.create(name: "Stuffstr")
r3 = Role.create(name: "Courier")
r4 = Role.create(name: "Seller")
